## Working with multiple queries


Working with multiple queries, it is convenient to write several queries in one tab and split them ";;"
Â 
Moving the cursor to the first or second query and pressing Cmd (Ctrl) + Enter - the query is performed under the cursor

Do not use the query history - all in one editor.

You can press Shift + Cmd + Enter - and all queries are executed at once in the editor.

Let's say you want:

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS default.x 
;;
CREATE TABLE default.x ( x Int32 ) Engine=Log
;;
INSERT INTO default.x 
SELECT 12345
```

You can enter this all into the field and execute at once

```

## Snippet

Often used code, as an example: `event_date = today ()` can be saved to the snippet and it appears in the autocomplete

## Transpose table

It can be very convenient to rotate the table which has a very large number of columns and few rows

## SQL + With totals

If the query specifies `WITH TOTALS`, the last row in the resulting table contains TOTALS

## Draw_Chart - [xAxis,yAxis]

You can specify the columns that are used for the axes

By default, the X-axis is used for plotting - the first column, or the DateTime column

On the Y axis, other columns are stored separately, if there is a column of type String, it becomes grouping

But sometimes it is necessary to build a graph only on the given columns:
